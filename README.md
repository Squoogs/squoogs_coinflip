# squoogs_coinflip
Flip a coin between friends with this FiveM resource!

This will add chat messages using FiveM's stock chat resource notifying you whether the coin toss was heads, tails, or if the coin even managed to land on it's side, standing up. Simply add the resource to your server.cfg and it will work out of the (metaphorical) box.
